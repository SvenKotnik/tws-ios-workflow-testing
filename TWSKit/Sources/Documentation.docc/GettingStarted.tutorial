            @Step {
                Use ``TWSFactory`` to create a new instance. This instance will be your main point of accessing your snippets. Link up the managerâ€™s snippets with your local snippets array and call run() on the manager to start loading the snippets. 
                @Code(name: "TWSViewModel.swift", file: TWSViewModel.swift)
                
            }
            
            @Step {
                Start listening to the manager's events to be notified of changes of snippets
                @Code(name: "EventListening.swift", file: EventListening.swift)
                
            }
            
            @Step {
                Display your snippet using ``TWSView``. Pass along the @State variables if you want to be notified of snippet data
                @Code(name: "SnippetView.swift", file: SnippetView.swift)
                
            }
        }
    }
