### Downloading files

If you download a file through the ``TWSView``, the file will be stored in the app's documents directory. By default that folder is private and you have 2 options available to you:

**1 - Make your documents public:** In your info.plist make sure you've set the "UIFileSharingEnabled" to true. If you have used our project generator it will be already set to true.

**2 - Check the download completed callback:** On a successful download you'll receive an instance of ``TWSDownloadInfo``. This will include the full path to the downloaded file and you can use this URL to move the file to the location of your choosing.
